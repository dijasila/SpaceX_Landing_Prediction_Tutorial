# SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction Tutorial

![Project Banner](images/banner.png)

## Overview

This repository provides a tutorial on using Python and data science techniques to predict the landing success of SpaceX's Falcon 9 first stage. Through this project, you'll learn how to collect data via APIs, preprocess and analyze the data, and build a machine learning model to make predictions on Falcon 9 landings.

This tutorial is designed for beginner-to-intermediate data scientists and includes structured steps for each part of the data science workflow.

# Installation

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/SpaceX_Landing_Prediction_Tutorial.git
cd SpaceX_Landing_Prediction_Tutorial

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt


# Usage

This tutorial guides you through the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Collect data on Falcon 9 launches using the SpaceX API.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare data for modeling.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize and understand key patterns and features.
4. Model Building: Use machine learning to predict Falcon 9 landing outcomes.

To run the tutorial, start by opening the notebook in Jupyter:

jupyter notebook notebooks/SpaceX_Data_Collection_and_Analysis.ipynb


# Project Walkthrough

The following sections detail each step in the project:

1. Data Collection: We use the SpaceX API to retrieve launch data, focusing on variables relevant to Falcon 9 landings.
2. Data Processing: The data is cleaned and structured to ensure compatibility with machine learning models.
3. Exploratory Analysis: Visualizations are created to highlight trends and identify key factors.
4. Modeling: We train a model to predict landing outcomes and evaluate its performance.

### Next Steps

1. **Data Collection Scripts**: Move relevant code from the notebook into `scripts/data_collection.py`.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Transfer any data cleaning steps into `scripts/data_processing.py`.
3. **Model Training**: Create `scripts/model_training.py` for model-related code.
4. **Images**: Include any key visualizations in the `images/` folder, and update the README with these.

I’ll extract and adapt content from the notebook to create these components and a more polished README. Let me know if you’d like me to proceed with additional specifics! &#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}&#8203;
